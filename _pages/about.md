Hey! I am a final year undergraduate at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) with Honours.\\
I am enthusiastic about hardware architecture and security. My interest lies in microarchitectural security and architecture for parallel computing.

Besides academia, I indulge myself in various sports activities. Table tennis, football, and badminton are among my favourites along with inline skating.
