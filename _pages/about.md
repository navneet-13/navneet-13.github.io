Hey! I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech. I am enthusiastic about computer architecture and security. My interest lies in microarchitectural security and architecture for parallel computing. I am currently working with Prof. Daniel Genkin on CPU side-channel attacks. 
I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My undergraduate research was on randomized caches to defend against conflict-based side-channel attacks.


Besides research, I indulge myself in various sports activities. Table tennis, football, and badminton are among my favorites along with inline skating.
